# judge-agg-dynamics
Python library for boolean algebra on arbitrary boolean sentences. Created towards my undergraduate thesis research at Pomona College in modeling social epistemology with dynamical systems.

Soon, this readme will include a detailed overview of the project and its functionality,
including references to my thesis explaining the underlying theory. As of now, I am wrapping
up the writing of the thesis and running some final experiments. After the thesis is submitted in
April, I will take the time to document this codebase. Until then, stay tuned!
