# judge-agg-dynamics
Python library for Markov Chain analysis of constrained belief propagation through  
social networks of rational agents. Created towards my undergraduate 
thesis research at Pomona College in modeling social epistemology with dynamic systems,
titled "Judgment Aggregation in Social Networks: A Model of Deliberative Democracy."

Soon, this readme will include a detailed overview of the project and its functionality,
including references to my thesis explaining the underlying theory. As of now, I am wrapping
up the writing of the thesis and running some final experiments. After the thesis is submitted in
April, I will take the time to properly document this codebase. Until then, stay tuned!
