"""
Belief Base

This class represents belief systems as a set of propositional
sentences under standard logic. Given a number of atomic propositions
and logic constraints on those propositions, the class computes
every combination of truth values that render the given belief system
true with the respect to the constraints. 

Using the parlance of judgment aggregation theory, the class computes
every possible consistent judgment set on a given agenda. 

Logical sentences are understood in Polish notation:

['implies', 'p', 'q'] yields 'p implies q'
